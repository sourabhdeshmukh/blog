      <description>The NULLCON - Internation Security Conference 2018 GOA was sheduled from 27th Feb to 3rd March, as first three days for the training days&amp;rsquo; and the conference days were 2nd March and 3rd March. The Venue of Conference was Holiday Inn Resort near Mobor Beach, Goa. Nullcon happens every year on the same place and it was my First Security Conference.
I was waiting for this conference from very long time, because I was too much exited learning about bug-hunting methodologies.</description>
