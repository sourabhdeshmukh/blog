        <span class="post-date">Aug 23, 2018</span>
        It all started back in 2016 around Jan/Feb, when I first saw Virtual box having kali linux installed in my laptop. It is installed by one of my friend as he took my laptop for learning about penetration and security tools workshop. Earlier I had only heard the name of kali in some of the hollywood movies so I was knowing about little about it such as this OS is used by bad people to destroy others mostly enemies.

        <span class="post-date">Jul 28, 2018</span>
        In these post I am going to brief you about the containers. Container is like a VM, I am not denying that but they are not VM. Consider if we want to install and run application in two different VMs, we need to download binary of that applications which might have other dependencies apart from which already present inside binary. After downloading we need to install it which will install the application as well as it will check for dependencies, if they are present then only it will get install or sometimes what happens with some apps they get install but denies to run due to lack of dependencies.
